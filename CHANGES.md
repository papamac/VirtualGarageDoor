Release Notes
==========
Releases and major changes to the Virtual Garage Door plugin are described in
this CHANGES.md file.  Changes of lesser importance may be described in the
changes section of individual module docstrings if appropriate.

Beta Version 0.9.1, June 7, 2022
-----------
This is the initial beta version of the Virtual Garage Door plugin for Indigo,
including support for an activation sensor. The author (papamac) has
subsequently concluded that the use of an activation sensor may cause the
opener device door state to lose synch with the door in some circumstances.
Because the activation sensor has limited utility, support for this feature
will be withdrawn in the initial beta release that will be available soon.


Nevertheless, if you don't configure your opener devices with an activation
sensor, this version should work fine. It is functionally complete and tested
by the author.  Some documentation is still in work, but the README file
should be sufficient to get you started.

Your bug reports, comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  Send
them to papamac on the Indigo user forum.
