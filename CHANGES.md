# Release Notes #

Releases and major changes to the Virtual Garage Door plugin are described in
this CHANGES.md file.  Changes of lesser importance may be described in the
changes section of individual module docstrings if appropriate.

## Initial GitHub release v1.0.0, July 22, 2022 ##

This is the initial version of the Virtual Garage Door plugin for Indigo.
It is fully functional and documented in README.md and GitHub WIKI. Code
documentation in plugin.py is still in work.

The activation sensor feature that was implemented in version 0.9.1 is no
longer supported because of its limited usefulness.

Your bug reports, comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  Send
them to papamac on the Indigo user forum.
